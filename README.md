Python Control Structures Assignment

This repository contains solutions for two Python programming tasks as part of Module 3: Control Structures in Python.

GitHub Profile: https://github.com/Tejusd09

Task 1: Even or Odd Number Checker (task1_even_odd.py)

Description
A Python program that checks whether a user-input integer is even or odd using if-else control structure.

Features:
- Takes an integer input from the user
- Uses modulo operator (%) to check even/odd
- Implements if-else statement for decision making
- Includes error handling for invalid inputs

How to Run:
python task1_even_odd.py

Sample Output:
Even or Odd Number Checker
---------------------------
Enter an integer: 17
The number 17 is Odd.

Task 2: Sum of Integers from 1 to 50 (task2_sum_1_to_50.py)

Description
A Python program that calculates the sum of all integers from 1 to 50 using a for loop.

Features:
- Uses for loop to iterate through numbers 1 to 50
- Accumulates sum using a running total variable
- Displays the final calculated sum
- Includes verification using mathematical formula

How to Run:
python task2_sum_1_to_50.py

Sample Output:
Sum of Integers from 1 to 50
----------------------------
Calculating sum...

Result:
The sum of all integers from 1 to 50 is: 1275
Verification using formula (n*(n+1)/2): 1275
✓ Calculation verified successfully!

Mathematical Concept:
The sum of first n natural numbers is calculated using the formula:
Sum = n × (n + 1) ÷ 2
For n = 50: 50 × 51 ÷ 2 = 1275

Requirements
- Python 3.x
- No external libraries required

Control Structures Used:
- if-else statement (Task 1)
- for loop with range() function (Task 2)
- try-except blocks for error handling
